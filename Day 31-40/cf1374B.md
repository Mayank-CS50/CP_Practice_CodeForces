B. Multiply by 2, Div by 6

TOOK HELP FROM GPT, COULDN'T GET THE INTUTION TOTALLY FROM MYSELF

Simple si chiz is....
2 operations that we can perform are : 
a. multiply no. by 2 
b. div by 6
objective : to make it 1

INTUTION is :
when divide krte hain, it removes 2 and 3 from the prime factor ki list,
and other operation me we can add 2 to the list, 
which means,
1.we can neither add 3, not can we have any other prime factor other than 2,3
2.we can only reduce 3, once by diving by 6 in an operation
so always, count3 > count2 in prime factor table
if not, it's impossible

So argument is : total 2's add krna, to equalise them is (count3-count2) and plus, the div/6 operations to eliminate all the 2's and 3's to make it 1
Thus, ans = (count3-count2)+count3

and DONE
