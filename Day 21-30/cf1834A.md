A. Unit Array

Question states and array having only 1's and -1's,
to it to be a good array, two conditions must hold
a. sum(all)>=0
b. product(all)==1
in an op. we can invert -1 to 1 and vice versa

Minimum op, to make it good array, approach is :

checking for initial count of both the instances,
if 1's>-1's then obv. sum is NoNe (Non Negative)
            then checking if parity is odd, then return 1
                          else, return 0 (kyunki even -1's prod. is 1)
elif counting the processes to make both of them equal,
then again checking the -1's parity, if odd then count+1
                                     else, count

Yet another brute force,
Needs no explanation, 
Bas 2-4 if else ka khel (:')
