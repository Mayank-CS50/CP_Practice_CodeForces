Tried all i could but didn't make it
Question asks if n can be formed by using only 2 and k in any amount used

Argument is : for 2* x + k*y=n, is x,y>=0 is possible

Case 1, if n is even, then put y=0, all good and easy
Case 2, if n is odd, then using equation provided,
we can deduce,
    2x = (n-ky)

    a. if k is even
    2x = (n-ky)
    (even)=(odd-even*y) [let y be anything, odd or even, it will become even, and odd-even is (5-2)=3 is odd, so LHS!=RHS] 
    <IMPOSSIBLE CASE>

    b. if k is odd
    2x = (n-ky)
    (even)=(odd-odd*y) [for all odd y exists such that, RHS is (odd-odd)-> even, so LHS=RHS]

So,
The only possible cases,
1. if n is even
2. or, if (n-k) is even
