A. Redstone?

The problem was simple arithmatic question as soon as written on paper,

The problem asks if there exists an arrangement of gears which can allow the gear at the rightmost corner to be spinning at 1Rpm only, when the speed of the current gear can be defined as :

Speed = (teeth in current gear)/(teeth in prev. gear) * spped of prev. gear



Apart from the logic, two more things learnt today,
1. writing the problem down clearly on paper is 70% work done
2. reading the complete question with complete detail is Must !
