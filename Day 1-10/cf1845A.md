A.  Forbidden Integers

After all, all it took was little consideration into mind, and trusting my so called brute force

The problem asks, if an integer n can be formed by the sum of any required no's from 1 to k range except x : 

Brute approach, all no's can be made by summing 1, n times
base cases to be kept in mind,
if range is >1, then only it's possible
if x is not 1, then only
if x is 1, then, if number is even then it's possible to be formed from 2's sum
            but, if the no. is odd, then it's only possible if range is atleast till 3,
                    (visualising it, the last 2+_ will be replaced by 3 -> 2+1 )

Done

Had a little fever today, tho tried my best but couldn't do it on time
